# ELE809 — Digital Control System Design

This repository contains my notes, derivations, MATLAB/Simulink files, and laboratory work for **ELE809: Digital Control System Design**.

## 📘 Course Description
ELE809 deals with the **theory and implementation** of digital control systems. Major topics include:

- State-space modeling of dynamic systems  
- Discrete-time signals and systems  
- z-transform and inverse z-transform  
- Sampling theory: ideal sampling, reconstruction, quantization effects  
- Discrete equivalents of continuous transfer functions (ZOH, Tustin, Euler)  
- Stability analysis using:
  - Jury Stability Test  
  - Root Locus (discrete)  
  - Nyquist Stability Criterion (discrete)  
- Transform-based controller design  
- State-space digital controller design  
- Hardware/software considerations in digital control implementation  

Laboratory work includes experiments for an electro-mechanical system in the George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre.
